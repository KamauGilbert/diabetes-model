**Business Problem**


The management of a certain NGO Hospital would like to have a product developed that
would predict whether a person has diabetes or not.
The data were collected and made available by “The National Institute of Diabetes and
Digestive and Kidney Diseases” as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. Several
constraints were placed on selecting these instances from a larger database. In
particular, all patients here belong to the Pima Indian heritage (a subgroup of Native
Americans) and are females of ages 21 and above.


**Project Overview**

This project endeavors to employ classification methods to categorize individuals into two groups: those with diabetes and those without, utilizing the provided variables.
The variables encompass the number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure levels, skin thickness, insulin amount, BMI level, and age.
The dataset underwent preprocessing and was sourced from Kaggle.
